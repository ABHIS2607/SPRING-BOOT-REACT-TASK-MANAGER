# SPRING-BOOT-REACT-TASK-MANAGER
This project leverages a modern tech stack to deliver a smooth user experience and robust functionality. The frontend utilizes React for component-based development and Redux for efficient state management. Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to styling, while the Shaden UI library offers pre-built components to accelerate development. On the backend, Spring Boot serves as the foundation, coupled with Spring Security for secure user access. JWT (JSON Web Token) manages user sessions, and Spring Starter Mail facilitates email notifications. The MySQL database stores application data, and Razorpay integration enables secure payment processing.
